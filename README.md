# The aperiodic monotile in a variety of formats

This repository contains code and vector image files to produce [the aperiodic monotiles found by David Smith, Joseph Samuel Myers, Craig S. Kaplan, and Chaim Goodman-Strauss](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~csk/hat/).

There's a family of related shapes, each made of 14 edges (though two of the edges are parallel and adjacent so look like a single long edge).
Each edge is one of two lengths, ùëé or ùëè. The angles in the shape don't change.
There is [an interactive tool](https://somethingorotherwhatever.com/aperiodic-monotile/interactive.html) to draw the tiles with any choice of the parameters and download in SVG or PNG format.

There are three interesting monotiles, which each tile the plane aperiodically.

A 'hat':

A 'turtle':

And a 'spectre':

Each file produces a single copy of the tile. Several copies of the tile fit together to tile the plane. The 'hat' and 'turtle' monotiles only tile along with their reflections; the 'spectre' monotile tiles without reflections.

The files are:

* [hat-monotile.svg](hat-monotile.svg) / [turtle-monotile.svg](turtle-monotile.svg) / [spectre-monotile.svg](spectre-monotile.svg) - A vector graphics file for use in programs such as Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator.
* [hat-monotile-kites.svg](hat-monotile-kites.svg) / [turtle-monotile-kites.svg](turtle-monotile-kites.svg) - A vector graphics file showing the construction of each tile from kites.
* [hat-monotile.scad](hat-monotile.scad) / [turtle-monotile.scad](turtle-monotile.scad) - Code to produce the tile in [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/), for 3D printing.
* [hat-monotile.stl](hat-monotile.stl) / [turtle-monotile.stl](turtle-monotile.stl) - An STL file produced using the OpenSCAD code, which can be sent directly to a 3D printer, or manipulated in other 3D software.
* [hat-monotile.logo](hat-monotile.logo) / [turtle-monotile.logo](turtle-monotile.logo) - A LOGO script to draw the outline of the title with Turtle graphics.
